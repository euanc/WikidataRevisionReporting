# WikidataRevisionReporting
A proof of concept program for reporting on revisions to Wikidata data items made by a particular user.

The program is not comprehensive. It's only intended to show that you can retrieve from https://wikidata.org only data from users that you trust. 


Usage:

Using your commandline run the program with a QID and wikidata username as parameters, e.g.:

"python wikidataRevisionsReporting.py Q11272 YULdigitalpreservation"
